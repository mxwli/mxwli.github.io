			<h2>About This Website</h2>
			<p>This website was first was created as a sort of "utility closet" for myself to quickly be able to reach into from anywhere</p>
			<p>Items in blue are projects I created/cocreated. In the future I wish to implement live web demos</p>
			<p>Items in red are things I found useful, and would like to save.</p>
